## 🧠 About Me

I’m a software engineer passionate about **distributed systems**, **data infrastructure**, and **AI-powered analytics**.
My focus is on designing **scalable backend architectures** that bridge real-world operations with intelligent automation.

Before graduate school, I worked at **Ubisoft** on large-scale **data analytics infrastructure** for *Rainbow Six Siege*, and later at **Y&L Trading**, where I designed **serverless AWS pipelines** and **GenAI-driven microservices** for retail analytics.

Currently, I’m building and studying systems that merge **streaming data**, **cloud-native design**, and **machine learning**—turning technical complexity into clarity and reliability.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

* Advanced **Operating Systems & Networks**
* **Scalable ML inference systems** using AWS Bedrock & Claude
* **Observability & Cost Optimization** for serverless architectures

---

## 🧩 Philosophy

> *“Great systems don’t just scale—they explain themselves.”*

I believe in designing software that’s not only performant but understandable—where reliability, clarity, and human empathy coexist in the code.
